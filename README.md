## Input and Output Design

### Input Design for TicTacToeGame:

#### 1. Game Board Interactions:

- **Click on a Cell**:
  - **Input:** User clicks on a cell in one of the boards.
  - **Processing:** The system identifies the clicked cell and triggers the corresponding event handler.
  - **Output:** The system updates the game state and may trigger AI moves. The UI is updated to reflect the move.

#### 2. Settings Interactions:

- **Change Difficulty Level**:
  - **Input:** User changes the difficulty level using radio buttons.
  - **Processing:** The system detects the change event and adjusts the game difficulty accordingly.
  - **Output:** The system updates the game state with the new difficulty level.

#### 3. Game Controls:

- **Reset Game**:
  - **Input:** User clicks the "Reset" button.
  - **Processing:** The system detects the click event and resets the entire game.
  - **Output:** The system restarts the game with the default settings.

#### 4. End of Game Interaction:

- **Restart Game After Winning/Draw**:
  - **Input:** User clicks the "Restart" button displayed in the end game dialog.
  - **Processing:** The system detects the click event and resets the entire game.
  - **Output:** The system restarts the game with the default settings.

#### 5. Data Entry Validation:

- **Preventing Invalid Moves**:
  - **Input:** User attempts to make an invalid move (e.g., clicking on an already occupied cell).
  - **Processing:** The system checks the validity of the move and may ignore invalid actions.
  - **Output:** The UI remains unchanged, and the system prompts the user to make a valid move.

#### 6. Accessibility Considerations:

- **Support for Keyboard Input**:
  - **Input:** User interacts with the game using the keyboard (e.g., arrow keys for cell selection).
  - **Processing:** The system detects keyboard events and translates them into corresponding actions.
  - **Output:** The game state and UI are updated based on keyboard interactions.

#### 7. Error Handling:

- **Handling Unexpected Input**:
  - **Input:** User provides unexpected input or interacts with the system in an unforeseen way.
  - **Processing:** The system includes error handling routines to manage unexpected input scenarios.
  - **Output:** The system provides appropriate feedback or instructions to guide the user.

#### 8. User Guidance:

- **Instructions and Feedback**:
  - **Input:** User may need guidance on how to play or understand the game status.
  - **Processing:** The system includes instructions and provides feedback to guide the user.
  - **Output:** Clear instructions and informative messages are displayed to enhance the user experience.

## How to Play

- The game is played on a 4x4x4 board.
- It is played by two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 4x4x4 grid.
- X always goes first and is the human player.
- O is the computer player. The computer player is an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move. The AI has 3 levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. This difficulty level can be selected by the user and can be changed at any time during the game. The default difficulty level is Easy.
- The player who succeeds in placing four of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
- If the board fills up before either player wins, then the game is a draw.
- The game can be reset at any time by clicking the Reset button.
- Good luck and have fun!

### UI Interaction

- initialize()
  - Description: Sets up the game boards, attaches event listeners, and initializes the game state.
  - Usage: Called once on page load.
  - Parameters: None.

### Evaluate board method

- Create the score for the moves of the board. Is returned to the minimax function
  - Iteration through Levels: The function iterates through each level of the 4x4x4 game board, evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals within each level.
  - Evaluate Line Function: A helper function, evaluateLine, is used to calculate the score for a given line (row, column, or diagonal) on the game board. It counts the number of player pieces and empty spaces in the specified positions.
  - Diagonals Within a Level: Diagonals within a level are considered, contributing to the overall score.
  - Verticals Across Levels: Vertical alignments across levels are assessed, adding to the score.
  - Cube Diagonals: Cube diagonals are evaluated for both players ("O" and "X"), influencing the final score.

### Minimax method

- Parameters:
  - depth (type: number): The current depth in the minimax search tree. It represents how many moves ahead the algorithm should explore.
  - alpha (type: number): The alpha value for alpha-beta pruning. It represents the best (maximum) value that the maximizing player can guarantee at the current level or above.
  - beta (type: number): The beta value for alpha-beta pruning. It represents the best (minimum) value that the minimizing player can guarantee at the current level or above.
  - isMaximizingPlayer (type: boolean): A boolean indicating whether the current player is the maximizing player ("O") or the minimizing player ("X").
- Return Value

  - (type: number): The evaluation score for the current state of the game board. The score represents the advantage or disadvantage of the board position for the maximizing player.

- Base Cases:

  - If the depth parameter is 0 or the game is over, the function returns the result of the evaluateBoard function for the current board state.

- Maximizing Player (AI, "O"):
  If isMaximizingPlayer is true, the function initializes maxEval to negative infinity.
  It iterates over all available moves, applying each move hypothetically and recursively calling minimax with reduced depth for the minimizing player.
  The best move and score are updated based on the maximum of the current score and maxEval.
  The alpha value is updated to the maximum of the current score and the alpha value.
  If beta is less than or equal to alpha, pruning occurs, and the loop is terminated.

- Minimizing Player (Human, "X"):
  If isMaximizingPlayer is false, the function initializes minEval to positive infinity.
  It iterates over all available moves, applying each move hypothetically and recursively calling minimax with reduced depth for the maximizing player.
  The best move and score are updated based on the minimum of the current score and minEval.
  The beta value is updated to the minimum of the current score and the beta value.
  If beta is less than or equal to alpha, pruning occurs, and the loop is terminated.

- Final Outcome:
  The function returns the maximum score (maxEval) if the current player is the maximizing player; otherwise, it returns the minimum score (minEval) for the minimizing player.
